  - <b> Redundancies of African port hinterlands and their implications for new container port investments </b> Jasper Verschuur, Lori Tavasszy: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856426000613 - *Abstract: "Here, we analyse the port-hinterland redundancies across Africa, a continent with a small number of gateway ports serving large hinterlands and large investment need in the coming decades, providing a window of opportunity to embed redundancy in strategic transport investments. We find that regions with high accessibility, in particular coastal cities close to a major seaport (e.g., Namibia, Senegal, Kenya) have low redundancy. In contrast, some landlocked hinterlands (e.g., Zambia, Zimbabwe, Niger, and Chad) have low accessibility, yet high redundancies given their reliance on different port ranges."*

  - <b> Travel Time Prediction from Sparse Open Data </b> Geoff Boeing, Yuquan Zhou: https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qepc6_v1 - *This article introduces a free, open-source minimally-congested driving time prediction model with minimal cost, data, and computational requirements. It trains and tests this model using the Los Angeles, California urban area as a case study by calculating naïve travel times from open data then developing a random forest model to predict travel times as a function of those naïve times plus open data on turns and traffic controls. Validation shows that this interpretable machine learning method offers a superior middle-ground technique that balances reasonable accuracy with minimal resource requirements.*
  - <b> Jobs and Skills for the New Economy: An Action Agenda for a People-Centered Climate Transition </b> WRI/GIZ: https://www.wri.org/research/jobs-skills-new-economy-action-agenda - *This report provides extensive analysis to support su*ch a whole-of-society effort and calls on leaders to commit and contribute to a 10-point Action Agenda to secure it. The Action Agenda provides a menu of practical and ambitious actions, with the understanding that its application will differ across country and industry contexts, depending on policy readiness, institutional capacity, basic infrastructure, and access to finance. To encourage countries and industries to pursue the Action Agenda and support its application within their specific contexts, this report also calls for a major global initiative that will bring together stakeholders and platforms through shared knowledge and research, peer-to-peer learning, technical assistance, and advocacy.
