- <b> Data and statistics </b>
- <b> Urban mobility </b>
  <b> Urban expansion in the age of liberalism </b> Samuel Hughes: https://worksinprogress.co/issue/urban-expansion-in-the-age-of-liberalism/ - *Many Victorian cities grew by tenfold in a century. Could ours ever do the same?*
- <b> Social issues </b>
- <b> Climate and environment </b>
- <b> Transport infrastructure and services </b>
  - <b> On the Road to Recovery : Addressing Ukraine’s Transport Labor Shortages </b> World Bank: https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/099121325144510117 - *This study provides an assessment of Ukraine’s transport workforce and skills landscape during a period of profound change. As maritime and air routes remain suspended, road freight, road passenger, and urban public transport have become the backbone of domestic and international mobility, and therefore the focus of this report. It examines critical labor shortages and skills gaps in these transport subsectors, drawing on secondary sources such as current literature and available statistics, as well as primary sources, including stakeholder interviews, an online industry survey, job advertisement analysis, and labor demand forecasting for transport jobs. The focus is on drivers, maintenance personnel, and several other key roles essential for the sector to function properly, all of which are experiencing severe shortages. The study identifies the structural factors behind these gaps to inform actions that align workforce development with the sector’s reconstruction and modernization needs.*
- <b> Logistics and Trade </b>
  - <b> Redundancies of African port hinterlands and their implications for new container port investments </b> Jasper Verschuur, Lori Tavasszy: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856426000613 - *Abstract: "Here, we analyse the port-hinterland redundancies across Africa, a continent with a small number of gateway ports serving large hinterlands and large investment need in the coming decades, providing a window of opportunity to embed redundancy in strategic transport investments. We find that regions with high accessibility, in particular coastal cities close to a major seaport (e.g., Namibia, Senegal, Kenya) have low redundancy. In contrast, some landlocked hinterlands (e.g., Zambia, Zimbabwe, Niger, and Chad) have low accessibility, yet high redundancies given their reliance on different port ranges."*
  - <b> Advancing a Cross-Regional Connectivity Agenda with Central Asia, Türkiye and the South Caucasus </b> EU4Digital : https://enlargement.ec.europa.eu/document/download/9f40a883-2489-4d40-8115-948e840ceca5_en?filename=Meta%20Study%20-%20Advancing%20a%20Cross-Regional%20Connectivity%20Agenda.pdf - *The study identifies priority investment needs to strengthen transport and trade, energy, and digital connectivity along the Trans-Caspian Transport Corridor (TCTC). It highlights key sections where infrastructure is missing, outdated, or no longer suited to current and projected volumes. As such, it aims to provide a foundation for defining investment priorities in line with the EU’s broader efforts to enhance trade routes along the corridor.*

- <b> General </b>
  - <b> Travel Time Prediction from Sparse Open Data </b> Geoff Boeing, Yuquan Zhou: https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qepc6_v1 - *This article introduces a free, open-source minimally-congested driving time prediction model with minimal cost, data, and computational requirements. It trains and tests this model using the Los Angeles, California urban area as a case study by calculating naïve travel times from open data then developing a random forest model to predict travel times as a function of those naïve times plus open data on turns and traffic controls. Validation shows that this interpretable machine learning method offers a superior middle-ground technique that balances reasonable accuracy with minimal resource requirements.*
  - <b> Jobs and Skills for the New Economy: An Action Agenda for a People-Centered Climate Transition </b> WRI/GIZ: https://www.wri.org/research/jobs-skills-new-economy-action-agenda - *This report provides extensive analysis to support such a whole-of-society effort and calls on leaders to commit and contribute to a 10-point Action Agenda to secure it. The Action Agenda provides a menu of practical and ambitious actions, with the understanding that its application will differ across country and industry contexts, depending on policy readiness, institutional capacity, basic infrastructure, and access to finance. To encourage countries and industries to pursue the Action Agenda and support its application within their specific contexts, this report also calls for a major global initiative that will bring together stakeholders and platforms through shared knowledge and research, peer-to-peer learning, technical assistance, and advocacy.*
  - <b> Global Economic Prospects, January 2026 </b> World Bank: https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/bb904ec6-730f-4dd9-b1af-ad3153ee1616 - *The global economy is facing another substantial headwind, emanating largely from an increase in trade tensions and heightened global policy uncertainty. For emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), the ability to boost job creation and reduce extreme poverty has declined. Key downside risks include a further escalation of trade barriers and continued policy uncertainty. These challenges are exacerbated by subdued foreign direct investment into EMDEs. Global cooperation is needed to restore a more stable international trade environment and scale up support for vulnerable countries grappling with conflict, debt burdens, and climate change. Domestic policy action is also critical to contain inflation risks and strengthen fiscal resilience. To accelerate job creation and long-term growth, structural reforms must focus on raising institutional quality, attracting private investment, and strengthening human capital and labor markets. Countries in fragile and conflict situations face daunting development challenges that will require tailored domestic policy reforms and well-coordinated multilateral support.*
