  - <b> Urban expansion in the age of liberalism </b> Samuel Hughes: https://worksinprogress.co/issue/urban-expansion-in-the-age-of-liberalism/ - *Many Victorian cities grew by tenfold in a century. Could ours ever do the same?*
  - <b> Public Transport Improvement Roadmap for the Tashkent Region </b> World Bank: https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/52649dc7-954c-4bfe-9c1c-a86cfeff9d67 - *This study, requested by the Government of Uzbekistan, aims to support public transport reform. The objective is to develop a roadmap for improvements in public transport in Tashkent city and region that strengthens the delivery of the 2023 Presidential Resolution and align with the objectives and guidance of the draft Public Transport Strategy. This study is initiated by the Ministry of Transport (MoT), in association with the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MoEF) and Agency for Strategic Reforms (ASR). It is supported by the Korean Green Growth Trust Fund (KGGTF). The study focuses on strategic pillars corresponding to the government’s reform program. The pillars include (1) harmonizing institutional frameworks to support public transport development in the city and region; (2) strengthening open competition and private sector mobilization for public transport and roll out Gross Cost Contract (GCC) to regional corridors; (3) scaling up e-bus adoption through cost-effective business models and private capital mobilization; and (4) improving bus connectivity and accessibility between the city and the outlying regional towns through evidence-based bus priority design and infrastructure development.*

  - <b> South Africa’s Fragmented Cities: The Unequal Burden of Labor Market Frictions </b> World Bank: https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/4c961f86-6519-464f-8a03-8b185d106cfa - *Abstract
Using high-resolution administrative, census, and satellite data, this paper shows that South African cities are characterized by spatial mismatches between where people live and where jobs are located, relative to 20 global peers. Areas within 5 kilometers of commercial centers have 9,300 fewer residents per square kilometer than expected, which is 60 percent below the global median. Poor, dense neighborhoods are most affected. In Johannesburg, a 10-percentile increase in distance from the nearest business hub corresponds to a 3.7-percentile drop in asset wealth (a proxy of household wellbeing) and 4.9-percentile drop in employment. In Cape Town, the declines are 4.0 and 3.7 percentiles, respectively. Employment is 87 percent lower in the poorest decile than the richest in Johannesburg and 61 percent lower in Cape Town. These findings suggest that South Africa’s spatial organization of people and economic activity constrains agglomeration and reinforces inequality. This methodology provides a scalable and standardized data-driven framework to analyze spatial accessibility and agglomeration frictions in complex, data-constrained urban systems.*
  - <b> Operationalizing social justice theory in transport resource allocation </b>  Esta Qiu, David Rey, Travis Waller: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trd.2026.105218 - *Operationalizing social justice is challenged by the absence of a universal equity definition and inherent policy trade-offs. This study bridges theoretical social justice principles with operational decision-making by integrating four commonly discussed distributive justice theories—Utilitarianism, Rawls’ Egalitarianism, Prioritarianism, and Capabilitarian Sufficiency—into a bilevel bus frequency optimization model. It introduces linearized equity-oriented formulations to reflect the distinct distributive principles of these theories and proposes justice theory-driven equity metrics to evaluate distributive impacts using different ethical criteria.*

  - <b> Transport Emissions Analysis Methodology (TEAM): Supporting Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) and Results-Based Climate Finance </b> World Bank: https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/5ed824b3-dd0a-4b2a-94ef-871aeedc9bfa - *Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transport is essential for achieving national climate targets, yet the sector has lacked practical and credible tools to quantify the emissions impacts of policies in a way that supports monitoring, reporting, verification (MRV), and results-based climate finance. This report responds to that gap by presenting a robust, MRV-compatible methodology for analyzing transport emissions. The report introduces a scenario-based transport emissions analysis methodology (TEAM) and model that quantifies emission reductions by comparing a measured With Policy scenario against a conservative and credible Without Policy counterfactual. The methodology supports analysis both ex post, using observed data to measure achieved emission reductions, and ex ante, to assess the mitigation potential of proposed policies. The current application focuses on road transport—the largest source of transport emissions—while allowing for future expansion to other transport modes.*
  - <v> Handbook for Livable and Resilient Cities: Integrating Hazard and Risk Information into Urban Planning </b> World Bank: https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/d7ee1212-42ed-4d8a-9ffa-225152ee65df - *Rapid urbanization in cities worldwide has led to significant environmental, social, and economic challenges. These include heightened exposure to extreme weather and climate events, increased air and water pollution, rising poverty levels, shrinking green spaces, and greater risks to lives, livelihoods, and assets from natural hazards, disasters, and climate shocks. As these risks intensify, national and local governments must work together to improve urban livability and resilience through risk-informed urban planning. In this handbook, livable and resilient cities are defined as urban areas and their surroundings, where green urban growth, social inclusion, resilient built environments, and shared prosperity are promoted. The focus is on preventing and reducing the impacts of natural hazards and risks and the effects of climate change. In a livable and resilient city, planned and sustainable growth ensures people have access to healthy environments, affordable housing, basic services, jobs, and low-carbon transportation and economic opportunities.*
  - <b> Heat Stress, Air Pollution Risk and Population Exposure: Evidence from Selected Asian Countries </b> ADB: https://www.adb.org/publications/heat-stress-air-pollution-risk - *This paper examines heat stress and air pollution in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, Thailand, and Viet Nam, looking at patterns of exposure among different population groups and discussing policy implications.*

  - <b> On the Road to Recovery : Addressing Ukraine’s Transport Labor Shortages </b> World Bank: https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/099121325144510117 - *This study provides an assessment of Ukraine’s transport workforce and skills landscape during a period of profound change. As maritime and air routes remain suspended, road freight, road passenger, and urban public transport have become the backbone of domestic and international mobility, and therefore the focus of this report. It examines critical labor shortages and skills gaps in these transport subsectors, drawing on secondary sources such as current literature and available statistics, as well as primary sources, including stakeholder interviews, an online industry survey, job advertisement analysis, and labor demand forecasting for transport jobs. The focus is on drivers, maintenance personnel, and several other key roles essential for the sector to function properly, all of which are experiencing severe shortages. The study identifies the structural factors behind these gaps to inform actions that align workforce development with the sector’s reconstruction and modernization needs.*
  - <b> Understanding Transport Resilience: Assessment Approaches and Tools </b> World Bank: https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/b5fa3caa-9e53-416e-bf88-e082e8927dec - *The report highlights two emerging tools that reflect recent advancements in the cost efficiency of resilience analysis. The Global Resilience Index (GRI), developed by the University of Oxford and widely applied by World Bank transport teams, is an open-source geospatial model that facilitates rapid, low-cost vulnerability assessments using open data. Its application in the Kyrgyz Republic and Nigeria demonstrates how the GRI can effectively screen road networks, identify priority segments, and support policy dialogue and the development of Country Climate Development Reports in contexts where data and resources are limited. The report also highlights the Hazard & Risk Multi-Regional Assessment (HARMA) model, developed by the World Bank transport team. This model supports more in-depth analysis by assessing climate impacts on network performance, estimating economic losses from disruptions, and comparing adaptation options using cost-benefit metrics. A Pakistan case study illustrates how the HARMA model can be applied to prioritize investments, and provide economic justification for resilience interventions.*
  - <b> Greater Mekong Subregion Transport Sector Strategy 2030 Midterm Review and Update </b> ADB: https://www.adb.org/publications/gms-transport-strategy-20230-midterm-review - *The strategy covers 2018–2030, and this report includes plans for the second half of the implementation period. It considers progress and evolving issues and challenges, aiming to enhance the strategy’s contribution to the achievement of the GMS vision of a more integrated, prosperous, sustainable, and equitable subregion.*
  - <b> The Greater Mekong Subregion Innovation Strategy for Development 2030 </b> ADB: https://www.adb.org/publications/gms-innovation-strategy-development-2030 - *This report shows how the Greater Mekong Subregion Innovation Strategy for Development 2030 can speed progress towards the GMS-2030 Strategic Framework by stepping up cross-border integration, innovation, and the transition to a green economy.*

  - <b> Redundancies of African port hinterlands and their implications for new container port investments </b> Jasper Verschuur, Lori Tavasszy: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856426000613 - *Abstract: "Here, we analyse the port-hinterland redundancies across Africa, a continent with a small number of gateway ports serving large hinterlands and large investment need in the coming decades, providing a window of opportunity to embed redundancy in strategic transport investments. We find that regions with high accessibility, in particular coastal cities close to a major seaport (e.g., Namibia, Senegal, Kenya) have low redundancy. In contrast, some landlocked hinterlands (e.g., Zambia, Zimbabwe, Niger, and Chad) have low accessibility, yet high redundancies given their reliance on different port ranges."*
  - <b> Deep and Shallow Decarbonization in Supply Chains </b> World Bank: https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/eecfd051-7086-42f1-85ee-009c59516ae1 - *This paper examines how suppliers adjust their decarbonization choices when major customers obtain validated emission-reduction targets. Using global supplier-customer links matched to firm-level emissions and project-level data from voluntary carbon registries, the analysis shows that downstream climate pressure elicits both real and symbolic responses, but in systematically different ways across suppliers.*
  - <b> Advancing a Cross-Regional Connectivity Agenda with Central Asia, Türkiye and the South Caucasus </b> EU4Digital : https://enlargement.ec.europa.eu/document/download/9f40a883-2489-4d40-8115-948e840ceca5_en?filename=Meta%20Study%20-%20Advancing%20a%20Cross-Regional%20Connectivity%20Agenda.pdf - *The study identifies priority investment needs to strengthen transport and trade, energy, and digital connectivity along the Trans-Caspian Transport Corridor (TCTC). It highlights key sections where infrastructure is missing, outdated, or no longer suited to current and projected volumes. As such, it aims to provide a foundation for defining investment priorities in line with the EU’s broader efforts to enhance trade routes along the corridor.*
  - <b> African Trade and Investment for Global Resilience: The Mattei Lecture at the World Bank’s 2025 Africa Growth and Opportunity—Research in Action (AGORA) Conference </b> World Bank: https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/4a48a663-06c8-4fa7-bf49-556c274b93d2 - *This paper, based on the Mattei Lecture that the author delivered at the 2025 Africa Growth and Opportunity–Research in Action Conference, argues that Africa can anchor a new model of growth—and bolster global resilience—by shifting from commodity dependence to value-added production and deeper integration into trade and investment networks. Against a backdrop of strained multilateralism and falling foreign direct investment to developing economies, global trade remains more robust than presumed, with goods, services, and South-South flows expanding.*
  - <b> Mining corridors as catalysts for US-African partnerships: Building on the Lobito model </b> Atlantic Council: https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Mining-corridors-as-catalysts.pdf  - *In December 2025 the US and the DRC signed a strategic partnership agreement giving the US preferential access to Congolese mineral deposits. The next step should be to build the infrastructure necessary for African nations to derive sustainable wealth from their mineral assets, and for the US to reap the benefits of the strategic partnership agreement.The financing approach and public-private cooperation used to build the Lobito transportation corridor offers a playbook for the US and African governments and investors.*

  - <b> Travel Time Prediction from Sparse Open Data </b> Geoff Boeing, Yuquan Zhou: https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qepc6_v1 - *This article introduces a free, open-source minimally-congested driving time prediction model with minimal cost, data, and computational requirements. It trains and tests this model using the Los Angeles, California urban area as a case study by calculating naïve travel times from open data then developing a random forest model to predict travel times as a function of those naïve times plus open data on turns and traffic controls. Validation shows that this interpretable machine learning method offers a superior middle-ground technique that balances reasonable accuracy with minimal resource requirements.*
  - <b> Jobs and Skills for the New Economy: An Action Agenda for a People-Centered Climate Transition </b> WRI/GIZ: https://www.wri.org/research/jobs-skills-new-economy-action-agenda - *This report provides extensive analysis to support such a whole-of-society effort and calls on leaders to commit and contribute to a 10-point Action Agenda to secure it. The Action Agenda provides a menu of practical and ambitious actions, with the understanding that its application will differ across country and industry contexts, depending on policy readiness, institutional capacity, basic infrastructure, and access to finance. To encourage countries and industries to pursue the Action Agenda and support its application within their specific contexts, this report also calls for a major global initiative that will bring together stakeholders and platforms through shared knowledge and research, peer-to-peer learning, technical assistance, and advocacy.*
  - <b> Global Economic Prospects, January 2026 </b> World Bank: https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/bb904ec6-730f-4dd9-b1af-ad3153ee1616 - *The global economy is facing another substantial headwind, emanating largely from an increase in trade tensions and heightened global policy uncertainty. For emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs), the ability to boost job creation and reduce extreme poverty has declined. Key downside risks include a further escalation of trade barriers and continued policy uncertainty. These challenges are exacerbated by subdued foreign direct investment into EMDEs. Global cooperation is needed to restore a more stable international trade environment and scale up support for vulnerable countries grappling with conflict, debt burdens, and climate change. Domestic policy action is also critical to contain inflation risks and strengthen fiscal resilience. To accelerate job creation and long-term growth, structural reforms must focus on raising institutional quality, attracting private investment, and strengthening human capital and labor markets. Countries in fragile and conflict situations face daunting development challenges that will require tailored domestic policy reforms and well-coordinated multilateral support.*
  - <b> What Works for Work: A Guidebook to Proven and Promising Employment Solutions </b> World Bank: https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/d57b125e-e41a-4bec-93cf-02b32ccc6165 - *Governments in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) face growing pressure to create jobs amid shrinking fiscal space and weak growth prospects. Employment solutions - like active labor market programs (ALMPs), regulatory reforms, or alignment of social programs - are effective tools to address these challenges. Recent years have seen a strengthening evidence base for employment solutions, with rigorous evaluations indicating that well-crafted programs can achieve impacts that far exceed earlier interventions. This guidebook reviews those high-performing employment solutions and distills lessons on how to replicate them. It draws from more than a hundred successful programs and reforms implemented in diverse settings, showing that targeted and well-designed solutions can quickly make a difference in many different contexts.*
  - <b> Digital Public Infrastructure: Landscape and Opportunities in South Asia </b> ADB: https://www.adb.org/publications/digital-public-infrastructure-south-asia - *he publication explains how DPI acts as a foundation for digital economies and how it is being adopted in health, education, agriculture, transport, and logistics. It looks at gaps, challenges, and opportunities in six countries: Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. It also discusses DPI use cases from outside the region. The publication shares practical insights on how DPI can contribute to better development outcomes.*
